title="Simple graph">simple graph</a> is a graph without loops and
without multiple adjacencies. That is, each edge connects two distinct
endpoints and no two edges have the same endpoints. A simple edge is an
edge that is not part of a multiple adjacency. In many cases, graphs are
assumed to be simple unless specified otherwise.

no repeated vertices and consequently no repeated edges.
