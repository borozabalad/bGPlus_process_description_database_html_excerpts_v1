{'edge': '

An edge is (together with vertices) one of the two basic units out of
which graphs are constructed. Each edge has two (or in hypergraphs,
more) vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints. Edges may
be directed or undirected; undirected edges are also called lines and
directed edges are also called arcs or arrows. In an undirected
<a href="/wiki/Simple_graph" class="mw-redirect"
title="Simple graph">simple graph</a>, an edge may be represented as the
set of its vertices, and in a directed simple graph it may be
represented as an ordered pair of its vertices. An edge that connects
vertices <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">x</span>
and <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">y</span> is
sometimes written <span class="texhtml mvar"
