{'label': '

1.\\xa0\\xa0Information associated with a vertex or edge of a graph. A
labeled graph is a graph whose vertices or edges have labels. The terms
*vertex-labeled* or *edge-labeled* may be used to specify which objects
of a graph have labels. [Graph
labeling](/wiki/Graph_labeling "Graph labeling") refers to several
different problems of assigning labels to graphs subject to certain
constraints. See also [graph
coloring](/wiki/Graph_coloring "Graph coloring"), in which the labels
are interpreted as colors.

2.\\xa0\\xa0In the context of [graph
enumeration](/wiki/Graph_enumeration "Graph enumeration"), the vertices
of a graph are said to be labeled if they are all distinguishable from
each other. For instance, this can be made to be true by fixing a
one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and the integers from 1
to the order of the graph. When vertices are labeled, graphs that are
isomorphic to each other (but with different vertex orderings) are
counted as separate objects. In contrast, when the vertices are
unlabeled, graphs that are isomorphic to each other are not counted
separately.
